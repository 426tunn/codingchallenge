Junior Backend Coding Questions

## Pick any two of your choice:

- Departure Times
- SF Movies
- Food Trucks

1. Departure Times
   Create a service that gives real-time departure time for public transportation (use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user or accept address/zip code.
   Here are some examples of freely available data:

   - [511 (San Francisco)](https://511.org/open-data)
   - [Transport for London Unified API (London)](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)

2. SF Movies
   Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.
   The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Film Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

3. Food Trucks
   Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat)

## Technical spec:

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful! The architecture will be a back-end, providing a JSON in/out RESTful API and adding a swagger documentation is important. Feel free to use any other technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is respected. Include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other services.
We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them. Therefore, feel free to mention in your README how much experience you have with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.

## Constraints

We'd prefer that you try to stick to up to 4 hours to complete the challenge that most appeals to you, and we'll take this timebox into account when reviewing submissions.
If you run out of time, please make use of the README to tell us:

- How you'd complete the submission with more time
- Anything you'd add to extend the project, given more time
- Anything you had difficulties completing/unforeseen issues

## Note:

Using typescript can earn you additional points. Document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, etc.)
